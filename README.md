## Hi there 👋
I am madhumithaa, an UG engineering student from PSNA colege of engineering and technology.<br><br>
I'm currently working on ML and IOT based projects 🤓 and also doing freelancing with my team in college. 💪🔥<br><br>
Currently im more interested in UI/UX designing and coding. and i'm learning how to design in figma and started my journey towards frontend developing and studying HTML, CSS and Javascript and sooner planning to learn React js.<br><br>
I'm more fascinated in an environment where innovation blooms and ideas spark ✨🌻 everywhere like hackathons and competitions where i truly feel I'm learning and growing more towards my interests.	👩‍💼👩‍💻<br><br>
